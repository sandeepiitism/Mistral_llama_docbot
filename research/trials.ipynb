The \\ntransformation is backed by government policies and initiatives such as the National Rail \\nPlan, Amrit Bharat Station Scheme, Gati Shakti Multi -Modal Cargo Terminal , and Electric \\nLocomotive Factory -Madhepura. After all, for the nation to realise its progressive socio -\\neconomic goals, it is important that Indian Railways lives up to its fabled moniker – ‘lifeline \\nof the nation’. Under the Viksit Bharat vision, the Viks it Rail component encompasses \\nmodernization of railway infrastructure, track and rolling stock, electrification, \\nincorporation of advanced technologies for faster, safer and comfortable journey and \\nnetwork expansion to unconnected areas.

Of the \\nvolume of freight traffic carried by the mammoth transporter, nearly 48% is coal traffic. \\nHowever, with the country’s objective to reduce its carbon footprint and i ndustries \\nexploring hydro and solar power, coal traffic may decline in the long term, impacting \\nfreight traffic. The IR will likely consider the following options for maintaining and \\nenhancing freight share and revenue:  \\nTruck-on-train: A model like Banas dairy’s truck -on-train may be explored for other \\ncommodities, such as perishables and automobiles, to provide faster transportation and \\nreduce carbon emission.  \\nEstimated arrival time versus consistency: As passenger trains are timetabled and given \\nfirst preference, freight trains wait at or before junctions for want of path. As per a report \\nby TERI, the wait time may be 2 -6 hours and may lead to increased transit time. Informing \\ncustomers about approximate transit time and maintaining consistency with rega rd to \\narrival time may enable customers to plan onwards dispatch of freight effectively.  \\nOperationalisation of freight corridors : Due to the above mentioned constraint, \\noperationalisation of DFCs, economic corridors and port connectivity projects will bifurcate \\nfreight and passenger traffic, provisioning line capacity for specific purposes. This will \\nincrease the average speed of trains, reduce travel time and in turn lead to reduction of \\noperational cost.  \\nIndigenisation of railway technology:  Indigenisation of technology is a strategic \\ninitiative of IR, to reduce dependence and enhance self-reliance.

These initiatives highlight ' commitment to \\nsustainability and its role in supporting India's broader environmental and climate goals. \\nBy adopting these technologie s and practices, IR strives to become a greener and more \\nsustainable mode of transport.

IR is \\ninching closer to its mission, with the share of electrified tracks increasing  from \\n24% in 2017 to 40% in 202 and 86.7% by the end of 2022 -23. After full \\nelectrification IR would become the world’s largest green railway network. \\nElectrification reduces reliance on diesel locomotives, significantly lowering carbon \\nemissions and opera tional cost.

Railways is also in the process of converting majority \\nof its diesel engines into electric ones to further reduce carbon footprint.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Solar energy initiatives: IR has set a target to install 20 GW of solar power capacity \\nby 2024. Solar panels are being installed on rooftops of railway stations, workshops, \\nand other buildings, as well as on vacant railway land. Few trains have been \\nequipped with solar panels on roofs to power lights, fans and other electrical \\nsystems within coaches, reducing the need for diesel generators.\"),\n",

IR should adopt a strategic approach \\nto address issu es related to infrastructure, technology, sustainability, passenger services \\nand overall operational efficiency. Focus should be on adopting modern infrastructure \\nsolutions such as expansion of the high -speed rail network beyond the Mumbai -\\nAhmedabad corrid or to connect major cities, reducing travel time, boosting economic \\ngrowth and fast -tracking doubling and quadrupling of tracks to increase the capacity of \\ncongested routes.  \\nDespite various schemes, private sector participation has not been very forthcomi ng in \\nrailways, as compared to roads and airports. To some extent, private passenger and \\ncontainer train operations can be considered a success. Recently, multi -modal logistics \\nparks (MMLPs) have shown some uptake. Going forward, innovative initiatives are  \\nrequired to leverage capital, efficiency and technology of the private sector.   \\nIn order to increase the modal share of railways in freight, so as to cut down on cost of \\nlogistics and enhance sustainability in cargo movement, a multitude of initiatives n eed to \\nbe taken. This includes rationalisation of fare, addressing connectivity issues, promoting \\nprivate sector participation, development of customised wagons and containers, promoting \\nmulti-modal connectivity, making railways ‘user -friendly’ for industr ies such as e -\\ncommerce, and new marketing plans etc.  \\nTo transform IR into green railways, 100% electrification of broad -gauge network, energy \\nefficiency of locomotives and trains, harnessing solar power at railway stations need to be \\ninitiated in right earnest. Railways may consider mandating all its offices  and buildings to \\nuse solar panels, harvest rainwater, etc. Adoption of the RESCO model may be considered \\npan-India, not only to harness solar power, but also to utilise railway land parcels. \\nAdditionally, fast -tracking hydrogen -powered trains would provid e multi -fold benefits in \\nthe direction of green transportation technology, to support zero carbon emission goals as \\na clean energy source. Deployment of more energy -efficient rolling stock and focus on \\nlightweight material and regenerative braking systems,  to reduce energy consumption, \\nwould eventually add up towards carbon neutrality.  \\nBesides, adoption of advanced technologies such as AI and ML for predictive maintenance, \\nefficient scheduling and improved safety. All railway coach factories and manufactur ing \\nunits should be converted to smart manufacturing units with industry.  IoT could be \\nutilised for real -time monitoring of trains, tracks, and infrastructure and to ensure timely \\nmaintenance and minimal disruptions.
